# Skin-Disease-Classification-using-CNN

Skin diseases are a significant health problem worldwide, affecting millions of people of all ages. The accurate diagnosis of skin diseases is essential for their effective treatment. Traditional methods of skin disease diagnosis rely on visual inspection by dermatologists or medical practitioners, which can be time-consuming and subjective. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have emerged as a promising approach for skin disease detection due to their ability to automatically learn features from large datasets of skin images. In this research, we propose a novel deep learning-based method for skin disease detection that incorporates various data augmentation and preprocessing techniques to enhance the quality of the images. We evaluated several state-of-the-art deep learning models, including ResNet50, VGG16, Inception V3, and EfficientNet, to determine the best-performing model for our dataset. Our proposed method achieved a high accuracy on a test dataset of 5000 images, outperforming several state-of-the-art skin disease detection methods.

We evaluated four state-of-the-art deep learning models for skin disease detection using a dataset of 5000 images. The models were ResNet50, VGG16, Inception V3, and EfficientNet. The models were trained using preprocessed images and evaluated on the validation dataset to determine their accuracy in predicting skin diseases. The results showed that EfficientNet achieved the highest accuracy of 66.7% on the validation dataset, followed by Inception V3 with an accuracy of 38.27%. ResNet50 and VGG16 achieved accuracies of 41.14% and 39.52%, respectively for 10 epochs trained.
The selected model, EfficientNet, was then evaluated on the test dataset, and the results showed an accuracy of 74.48%, with a precision of 89%, recall of 72%, and an F1-score of 79%. The confusion matrix analysis showed that the model performed well in predicting all four categories with True Positive rates of the four classes Acne, Eczema, Psoriasis and Ringworm being 88.7%, 75.4%,64.73% and 79.33% respectively.
